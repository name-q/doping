- Multiple scripts can run simultaneously, each in its own terminal

### Configuration File

Create a `.doping` file in the workspace root (JSONC format, supports comments):

```jsonc
{
  "cn": true,  // Enable Chinese interface, defaults to English
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Main App",
      "path": ".",
      "packageManager": "pnpm run",
      "excludeScripts": ["*"],
      "includeScripts": ["dev", "build", "start"]
    },
    {
      "name": "UI Library",
      "path": "packages/ui-lib",
      "packageManager": "npm",
      "includeScripts": ["build", "test"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `cn`: Whether to use Chinese interface (defaults to false, shows English)
- `name`: Project display name (optional, defaults to directory name)
- `path`: Project relative path
- `packageManager`: Package manager command (defaults to "pnpm")
- `autoExpandProjects`: Whether to auto-expand all projects (defaults to true)
- `includeScripts`: Whitelist of scripts to show (supports glob patterns)
- `excludeScripts`: Blacklist of scripts to hide (supports glob patterns)

### Advanced Usage

#### Whitelist Mode
Use `excludeScripts: ["*"]` to exclude all scripts, then use `includeScripts` to specify which ones to show:

```jsonc
{
  "cn": true,
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": ".",
      "excludeScripts": ["*"],
      "includeScripts": ["dev", "build", "test"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Filter Auxiliary Scripts
Exclude pre/post and other auxiliary scripts:

```jsonc
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": ".",
      "excludeScripts": ["pre*", "post*"]
    }
  ]
}
```
